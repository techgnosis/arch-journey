sway is the best wayland compositor and steam works perfectly on it, including grim dawn

sway logs an error involving execvp, that error is referring to sway trying to execute `swaybg` but `swaybg` does not exist, just install it

sway uses `foot` as the terminal editor. make a config file at ~/.config/foot/foot.ini and add
`font=monospace:size=28` otherwise its too hard to read in 4k
