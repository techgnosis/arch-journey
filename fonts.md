Seems like all fonts live in /usr/share/fonts

That directory is empty unless you actually install some fonts

gnu-free-fonts populates that directory
all of the fonts from gnu-free-fonts have the .otf extension which makes them "OpenType" which is built on "TrueType"

its all managed by fontconfig and freetype2
